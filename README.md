Top level directories in `evaluation/` are different splits of NoCode-bench (full, verified).
* Each subfolder is a submission to that benchmark.
* A subfolder contains the predictions, results, execution logs, and trajectories (if applicable) for the submission.

These logs are publicly accessible and meant to enable greater reproducibility and transparency of the experiments conducted on the NoCode-bench task.
</details>

## 🔎 Viewing Logs, Trajectories
You can download the logs and trajectories for each submission by running the following command to download the data:
```bash
python -m analysis.download_logs evaluation/<split>/<date + model>
python -m analysis.download_logs evaluation/lite/20231010_rag_claude2
```
Logs and trajectories are saved to a public S3 Bucket. *You need an AWS account to download the logs and trajectories*. Namely, you'll need to create an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/), download the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), and [configure the CLI with your credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/command-line-sign-in.html).

Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure your submission is merged on time!

### NoCode-bench [Full, Verified]
1. Fork this repository
2. Under the split that you evaluate on (e.g. `evaluation/verified/`), create a new folder with the submission date and the model name (e.g. `20250722_openhands_gpt4`).
3. Within the folder (`evaluation/<split>/<date + model>`), please provide the following:

<summary>📋 Required Assets</summary>
<br>

  * `evaluation_details.jsonl`: Evaluation results on NoCode-bench.
  * `metadata.yaml`: See `checklist.md`
  * `README.md`: See `checklist.md`
  * `trajs/`: Reasoning traces reflecting how your system solved each task instance (see below for more details)
  * `logs/`: NoCode-bench evaluation artifacts dump
    - **NOTE**: You shouldn't have to create any of these files. They should automatically be generated by NoCode-bench evaluation.
